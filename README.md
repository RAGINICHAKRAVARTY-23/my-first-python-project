# My First Python Projects 

This repo contains my first Python programs — small, functional scripts I wrote while learning the basics.

## What I’ve Built

### 1. "basic_calculator.py"
A simple calculator that takes two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Handles user input and basic errors.

### 2. "mad_limbs.py"
A basic Mad Libs game. Takes input from the user (like nouns, verbs, adjectives) and inserts them into a pre-written story template.

### 3. "month_expenses.py"
Asks the user for income and monthly expenses, then calculates savings. Good practice for using variables, input, and math logic.

### 4. "marks_report.py"
Takes subject-wise marks from the user, calculates total and percentage, and prints a basic marksheet report and also displays the topper.

These are a collection of beginner-level Python scripts I built while teaching myself the fundamentals. Each file solves a basic real-life task using clean logic and simple input/output.
