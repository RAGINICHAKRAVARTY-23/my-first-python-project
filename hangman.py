Hangman is a simple word-guessing game made using Python.
In this game, a random word is selected, and the player has to guess the word one letter at a time.
For every wrong guess, the player loses a life, and a hangman figure is drawn step by step.
The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

This project was created by me while learning Python basics like loops, conditions, lists, and user input.
It helped me understand game logic and improve my problem-solving skills.
